                    <h3>Mental health</h3>
                    
                    <p>Mental illness affects the way we think, what we feel, how we act etc. 
                        Both your mental and physical health are very important in order to live a healthy life (cdc.gov). 
                        In the last decade, there has been a 13% increase in mental health conditions worldwide (who.int). 
                        With an increase of poor mental health comes premature death. 
                        Statistics from The world's health organisation shows that suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15-29-year-olds (who.int).

                    <h3>Premature mortality</h3>
                    <p>With bad mental health comes mental disorders (kilde). The National Centre for Register-based Research, Aarhus University in Denmark, 
                        conducted a 20 year study on 7,369,926 people looking at the link between mental health issues and premature mortality. The research 
                        shows that the mortality rates are higher for those diagnosed with a mental disorder than for the general population, 
                        28.70 deaths vs 12.95 deaths per 1000 person-years (Haapanen, Laurell). Mental illness, especially depression, increases the risk 
                        for many types of physical health problems, particularly long-lasting conditions like stroke, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease (cdc.gov).
