                        In the app you will be given a challenge to complete in order to ensure a good, stable mental health. 
                        The challenges will be based on recommendations from therapists, mental health experts and organizations.
                        The challenges will differ in difficulty depending on if it’s a daily, weekly or monthly challenge. 
                        A daily challenge could be to take a 30-minute walk. By doing this you will get fresh air and exercise, 
                        which will help your overall mental (and physical) health. A weekly challenge could be to reach out to a friend. 
                        This can be challenging for many people, as many people with bad mental health shut people out.
                        The app can be used by people with mental illness, bad mental health and/or by people who want to insure good 
                        mental health.
