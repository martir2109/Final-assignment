                        <p>A lot of people at all different ages are struggling with their mental health and are struggling to improve it.
                            Mental health is a very important and serious topic that needs to be brought up more. 
                            Therefore we chose to have UN's Sustainable Development goal number 3, <em>“Good health and well-being”</em>. 
                            The goal is about ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages (Nations, u.d.).

                    <div class="text_container">
                        <p>Our solution is to make more people at all ages improve their mental health. We came up with the idea of an app that can give the users daily quotes, daily/weekly or monthly challenges, all to what the user desires. The best outcome would be if the app could provide people from ending their life at an early age. 
                            We want to decrease the numbers of mortality from non-communicable diseases. (Nations, u.d.).
