                    <h3>Improving mental health</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are multiple ways to improve your mental health, such as talking about your problems, eating healthy, 
                        living an active lifestyle and keeping in touch with friends and family (Foundation, M. H., u.d.). 
                        We want to improve people's mental health by challenging people to do small tasks such as these in an app.

                    <p>We want to encourage good mental health in order to live a happy and healthy lifestyle. 
                        Since many people don't have the opportunity to go to a therapist, we wanted to create something to bring the help to them. 
                        In low- and middle-income countries, 76%-85% of people don't receive treatment for their mental health problems, 
                        and 35%-50% in high-income countries (WHO, 2011).

                    <h3>The Health First app</h3>
                    <p> The reason we chose an app to solve this problem was because we live in 2020, and most people use their phone multiple hours a day. 
                        Therefore a good way to reach the people is by making an app they can download on their phone. 
                        We chose to have a daily quote because of research from psychologist and motivation expert Jonathan Fader (Moran, G. 2015). 
                        We chose to implement a journal as it can be helpful to track your mental health and be able to read what 
                        made you have a good or bad day (Foundation, M. H., u.d.).
